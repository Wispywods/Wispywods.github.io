        I'm good at Lua programming and pixel art. My dream is to be an independent game developer.
        Generally speaking, I handle all aspects of game development when working on a project, producing art, music, scripts,
        and any other assets that need to be made. However, I do sometimes receive help from others, usually either my brothers
        or freelance artists. I work as independently as I can because I have no desire to be part of a large team.
        My best ideas are for game design, and working in a small team is the most effective way for my ideas to come to fruition.
