        This is the image I usually use as a profile picture. Rather than representing my physical appearance, it represents my interests.
        <p>I'm good at Lua programming and pixel art. My dream is to be an independant game developer.</p>

        <h1>I don't like most F2P games</h1>
        <p>To me, a game being free to play is usually something that actually discourages me from playing</p>
        <h2>Some reasons I don't like F2P games is because of how they're usually designed, while others are more abstract feelings they give</h2>
        <h3>F2P Game Design I don't like</h3>
        <p>F2P games often interrupt game flow by forcing the player to wait to do something or pay to bypass the cooldown.</p>
        <p>Besides that, a lot of F2P games don't really end. Even the story-based ones usually go on far too long. Having to wait for the story to be finished can really kill the hype.</p>
        <h3>Personal problems with F2P games</h3>
        <p>This is more abstract and harder to explain, but I feel the very fact that they're free to play can take away from the excitement of getting them.</p>
        <p>When you want a paid game, but have to think about it first, the time you spend thinking builds up tension, which is released when you play the game if you buy it.</p>
        <p>F2P games don't require as much thought to download, you can get them on a whim, so that tension and excitement is never built.</p>
