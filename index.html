        I'm good at Lua programming and pixel art. My dream is to be an independent game developer.
        Generally speaking, I handle all aspects of game development when working on a project, producing art, music, scripts,
        and any other assets that need to be made. However, I do sometimes receive help from others, usually either my brothers
        or freelance artists. I work as independently as I can because I have no desire to be part of a large team.
        My best ideas are for game design, and working in a small team is the most effective way for my ideas to come to fruition.

        My profile picture depicts Sophie Neuenmuller from Atelier Sophie holding an American Basswood Flower.
        Sophie is simply a character I really like, while the American Basswood Flower holds a bit more significance 
        to me in particular. They fall from trees and blanket the ground near my birthday, so when I was young, 
        they were something of a symbol of celebration. I wanted to go with a character I liked that would complement 
        this object of personal importance, and figured this profile picture did a good job. I'm very proud of it!

            I'm Kyle Johnston, but my most used username is Wispywods. I grew up playing many video games,
            so they've had a great impact on my life, which led to my desire to become a game developer.
            Records of my ideas date all the way back to 2014, when I was 8 years old, but I only started taking things
            seriously in 2020. I'm self-taught, but well versed in multiple areas and persistent enough to keep trying 
            as long as I have the will to succeed and the opportunity to try again.

            My two biggest collaboraters are my brothers, one of which specializes in music and the other of which specializes 
            in art. Since my greatest strength lies in programming, our skills complement each other very well and cover many areas 
            of game development. However, I often rely upon any other friends for quality assurance, or, if they're willing,
            sometimes they'll have a larger role in asset production or other areas.

            There are two major games I have planned for the future, but haven't gotten the chance to work much on yet.
            The first of them is a 3D fighting game with RPG elements, which has been in the works since 2020 and extensive 
            documentation of ideas, but very little actual progress on. The second of these ideas is a 2D platform crossover fighter
            similar to Super Smash Bros, but focused specifically around the hidden gems I've come across playing games and believe 
            deserve more recognition. I'm focusing on smaller projects first to explore any necessary areas of game development, 
            but I'm looking forward to developing bigger games once I have the skill.
